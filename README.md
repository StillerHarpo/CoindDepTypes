# Partial formalisation of a type theory based on mixed inductive-coinductive dependent types

The code in this repository is a formalisation of parts of the work in [1].
More precisely, we formalised the raw syntax and the reduction relation, which
were given in that paper.

In the future, I would like to have at least the typing rules and the proof of
subject reduction formalised.
